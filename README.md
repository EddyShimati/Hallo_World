# Hallo_World
Herein I will have ideas which I would like to birth for the benefit on Namibia and African community. These ideas evolves around the new technology of Cryptocurrency and how blockchain can change the world and living style.

I am a Namibian and I believe the world is advancing and advancing very fast. With the technology of blockchain everything seems to be possible where ever we are as long as we have access to internet. I have BSc Degree in Mechanical Engineering and MSc Degree in Transportation Engineering and thus I believe my knowledge can anly make sence to this world is integrate the blockchain technology in my work.
I therefore believe that since I understand this technology it is better, I should create something Namibian while educating the country.
